In accordance with the revised Investment Policy, the Board has delegated authority to manage the Company&#8217;s portfolio of securities investments to an Investment Committee of the Board (the "Investment Committee") consisting of the Company&#8217;s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Cohen, and two independent members of the Board, together with such personnel and advisors as the Investment Committee may choose. </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Merchandise Inventories</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value generally using the average cost method. Under the average cost method, as new product is received from vendors, its current cost is added to the existing cost of product on-hand and this amount is re-averaged over the cumulative units. Pre-owned gaming systems and other products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of cash or store credit given to the customer. We are required to make adjustments to inventory to reflect potential obsolescence or over-valuation as a result of cost exceeding market. In valuing inventory, we consider quantities on hand, recent sales, potential price protections, returns to vendors and other factors. Our ability to assess these factors is dependent upon our ability to forecast customer demand and to provide a well-balanced merchandise assortment. Inventory is adjusted based on anticipated physical inventory losses or shrinkage and actual losses resulting from periodic physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves as of February&#160;1, 2025 and February&#160;3, 2024</span><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> were $24.5 million and $38.8 million, res</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">pectively.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Property and Equipment</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation on fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred, while improvements and major remodeling costs are capitalized. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases, which includes reasonably certain renewal options. Costs incurred in purchasing or developing management information systems are capitalized and included in fixtures and equipment. These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the technology becomes operational. We periodically review our property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amounts may not be recoverable or its depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. We assess recoverability based on several factors, including our intention with respect to our stores and those stores' projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value, determined based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows or readily available market information for similar assets.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During fiscal 2024 we closed our York, Pennsylvania distribution facility, to consolidate U.S. fulfillment activities to our Grapevine, Texas facility. </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During fiscal 2024 we divested our operations in Italy, which included our facility in Milan, Italy.  </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During fiscal 2024 we relocated our U.S. refurbishment operations into our distribution and administration facility in Grapevine Texas.

Upon designation as held for sale, we record the assets at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value, reduced for the cost to dispose the assets. </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">During fiscal 2024, we sold certain properties in our Europe segment consisting of buildings, land, and other property and equipment.

If the carrying value of an individual indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, such individual indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired by the amount of the excess. We test our indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when circumstances indicate the carrying value might be impaired. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of digital assets and trade names.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Trade Names</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The fair value of our trade names are estimated by using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the value of the trade name is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid by a hypothetical market participant had they not owned the trade name and instead licensed the trade name from another company.&#160; We recognized no impairment charges during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022.

The satisfaction of a performance obligation with a single customer may occur at a point in time or may occur over time.

The significant majority of the digital products we sell are unbundled and do not require us to purchase inventory or take physical possession of, or take title to, inventory. When purchasing these products from us, consumers pay a retail price and we earn a commission based on a percentage of the retail sale as negotiated with the digital product publisher. We recognize the sale of these digital products on a net basis, whereby the commissions earned are recorded as revenue.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Rewards Program </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Our GameStop Pro</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:5.85pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;position:relative;top:-3.15pt;vertical-align:baseline">&#174;</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> rewards program allows paid members to earn points on purchases that can be redeemed for rewards that include discounts or coupons. When rewards program members purchase our product, we allocate the transaction price between the product and loyalty points earned based on the relative stand-alone selling prices and expected point redemption. The portion allocated to the loyalty points is initially recorded as deferred revenue and subsequently recognized as revenue upon redemption or expiration.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The two primary estimates utilized to record the deferred revenue for loyalty points earned by members are the estimated retail price per point and estimated breakage. The estimated retail price per point is based on the actual historical retail prices of product purchased through the redemption of loyalty points. We estimate breakage of loyalty points based on historical redemption rates. We continually evaluate our methodology and assumptions based on developments in retail price per point redeemed, redemption patterns and other factors. Changes in the retail price per point and redemption rates have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the deferred revenue liability through current period revenue by an amount estimated to represent the retail value of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by loyalty program members as of the end of the reporting period. The cost of administering the loyalty program, including program administration fees, program communications and cost of loyalty cards, is recognized in SG&amp;A expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Contract Liabilities </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We establish a liability upon the issuance of merchandise credits and the sale of gift cards. Revenue is subsequently recognized when the credits and gift cards are redeemed. In addition, we recognize breakage in revenue upon redemption and in proportion to historical redemption patterns, regardless of the age of the unused gift cards and merchandise credit liabilities. To the extent that future redemption patterns differ from those historically experienced, there will be variations in the recorded breakage. </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Vendor Arrangements</span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%"> </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We participate in vendor cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which vendors provide us with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors&#8217; products. Our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs results in a significant portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory rather than as an offset to our marketing and advertising costs. The consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of vendor allowances to be recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined based on the nature of the consideration received and the merchandise inventory to which the consideration relates. We apply a sell-through rate to determine the timing in which the consideration should be recognized in cost of sales. Consideration received that relates to gaming products that have not yet been released to the public is deferred as a reduction of inventory.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs generally cover a period from a few days up to a few weeks and include items such as product catalog advertising, in-store display promotions, internet advertising, co-op print advertising and other programs.

Income taxes are accounted for utilizing an asset and liability approach and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. In accordance with GAAP, we maintain liabilities for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the applicable taxing authority, available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount.

We also lease certain equipment and vehicles. These are generally leased under non-cancelable agreements and include various renewal options for additional periods. These agreements generally provide for minimum, and in some cases, percentage rentals, and require us to pay insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs. Percentage rentals are based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums at various stores and are accounted for in the period in which the amount of percentage rentals can be accurately estimated. All of our lease agreements are classified as operating leases.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">We determine if an arrangement is considered a lease at inception. We recognize right-of-use ("ROU") assets, on the commencement date based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term, including reasonably certain renewal options. As the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for most leases, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate ("IBR") to determine the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents a significant judgment that is based on an analysis of our credit rating, country risk, corporate bond yields and the effect of collateralization. For our real estate leases, we do not separate the components of a contract, thus our future payments include minimum rent payments and fixed executory costs. For our non-real estate leases, future payments include only fixed minimum rent payments. We record the amortization of our ROU assets and the accretion of our lease liabilities as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which includes option terms we are reasonably certain to exercise. We recognize our cash or lease incentives as a reduction to the ROU asset. We assess ROU assets for impairment in accordance with our long-lived asset impairment policy, which is performed periodically or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%">Foreign Currency</span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Generally, we have determined that the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are the subsidiaries&#8217; local currencies. The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate as of the end of the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at an average rate over the period. Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss. Currency translation adjustments related to divested foreign businesses are reclassified into earnings as a component of SG&amp;A in our Consolidated Statements of Operations once the liquidation of the respective foreign businesses is substantially complete. </span></div><div style="margin-top:9pt"><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and derivatives resulted in a net loss </span><span style="background-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">of $0.9 million, </span><span style="color:#000000;font-family:'Arial',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">$2.0 million, and $2.6 million, for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
